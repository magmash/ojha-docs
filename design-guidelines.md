# Ojha – Design Guidelines

## 🎨 Visual Style
- **Font**: Inter (simple, modern, readable)
- **Primary Color**: #2D2DFF (deep indigo)
- **Accent Color**: #FA709A (soft pink)
- **Backgrounds**: Clean white (#FFFFFF) and soft neutral grays (#F7F7F7, #EAEAEA)
- **Status Colors**:
  - Feedback Unread: Light Red
  - Feedback Resolved: Light Gray
  - Approved: Light Green

## 📐 Page Layout Principles
- Mobile-first design
- Card-based layout on dashboard and project lists
- Split-view design in project pages (e.g., Brief | Moodboard | Revisions)
- Use clear spacing and padding for all containers (min. 16px)
- Sticky headers on scroll for navigation within project views

## 🔤 Typography
- Hierarchical sizing (e.g., 24px for titles, 16px for body)
- Strong use of bold for section titles, regular for body
- Maintain high contrast between text and background

## 🔧 Components Style
- Buttons: Rounded (xl), bold text, soft shadows
- Project Cards: Status badge, hover shadow, last-updated timestamp
- Comments: Speech-bubble style, nested threads, clear resolve/delete actions
- File Uploads: Drag-and-drop area with hover highlight, image previews
- Moodboard: Grid view with hover-to-enlarge effect

## ✅ Accessibility
- Text contrast ratio AA minimum
- Large tap targets for mobile
- Alt text required on all uploads/images
- Keyboard navigation for major actions
- Color-blind friendly indicators (e.g., icon + color, not color alone)

## 💬 Brand Tone/Voice
- Friendly, focused, and confident
- Avoid jargon – use terms like "Upload Design", not "Submit Asset"
- Keep microcopy light and helpful (e.g., "Waiting on feedback from client ✉️")

## 🧪 Animation & Transitions
- Use subtle motion (fade in/out, slide-up on modals)
- Apply transitions to file uploads, comment pins, and status changes
- Avoid overly playful animations – prioritize clarity over flair
